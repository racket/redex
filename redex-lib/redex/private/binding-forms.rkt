== How binding forms work ==


 (For some theoretical background, look up "Romeo: A System for More Flexible Binding-Safe
  Programming", in ICFP 2014.)


The binding information provided to `define-language` by `#:binding-forms` is converted (in
binding-forms-compiler.rkt) into a binding table: a list mapping `compiled-pattern`s to
`bspec`s (`bspec` is defined in `binding-forms-definitions.rkt`). Everything else is the
responsibility of this file. (In the paper, the type system is used to determine the binding
behavior of values, but in Redex, we use pattern-matching.)

  Important concepts for binding specifications:

    * Inside a particular binding form, a "beta" is a set of sources of names, organized
      with "shadow" to indicate how to shadow. They correspond to `β` in the paper.
    * If a name source is more complex than a single name, it should be a binding form with an
      `#:exports <beta>` clause, whose beta indicates what names to provide.
    * To actually bind names, the (pattern matching the) subterm that binds them should be
      annotated with `#:refers-to <beta>`. (This becomes `import/internal`, internally.)

   Less important concepts for binding specifications:
    * `...` is internally turned into `.../internal`, which stores a list of names that that
      "drive" the repetition (as opposed to being merely duplicated each iteration)
    * `#:...bind` is internally turned into `...bind/internal`. Each iteration is considered a
      separate binding object, with its own bspec. (The magic of `#:...bind` is that the
      individual repetitions don't need to be pattern-matched on their own: one big pattern-match
      constructs many nested values with their own binding behavior.)


The rule we have to follow for correctness is "freshen values before destructuring them".  Redex's
destructuring all goes through the pattern-matcher, so that's where the entry point is. `freshen`
needs to know the binding table for the current language. To avoid a circular import, it needs to
have access to `match-pattern`. It also needs the value it should freshen. The binding table and
`match-pattern` get thrown into parameters for easy access later, as do a couple of internal things
that help out `α-equal?` and `safe-subst`: the name-generator to use and how aggressively to
freshen.

  Important concepts for freshening:

   * `dispatch` figures out which (if any) binding form a particular value is, for functions that
      are sensitive to binding. In the case where the value is a binding form, it is turned into
      a Redex match for handling.
   * `rec-freshen` freshens a value, and returns a substitution indicating how its exported binders
      were renamed. Its parameters mostly control what binders actually get freshened; see the
      header of `rec-freshen` for details.
   * `rename-references` renames the free references in a value.
   * `exported-binders` (implemented in terms of `rec-freshen`) returns a list of names that are
      exported from a particular value

  Less important concepts for freshening:

   * `interp-beta` folds over the name sources in a `beta`.
   * a substitution (`σ`) is represented as a list of two-element lists (original and replacement).
   * `pass-...` turns a Redex match into a set of Redex matches, one for each iteration of a `...`
   * `splay-...bind` turns a Redex match into a nested set of Redex matches, where each
      iteration of a `...bind` is its own `value-with-spec` (a pair of a Redex match and a bspec,
      since `dispatch` cannot otherwise figure what kind of binding form the `...bind` iterations
      are).

In addition to freshening, we provide convenience functions for alpha-equivalence and substitution.
The later is straightforward to safely define as a metafunction, and the former is more work, but
both of these are things that we can do faster internally. In each case, we use `all-the-way-down?`
to traverse the whole value at once, rather than one binding form at a time.





  Name collision that is a potential source of confusion:
   * A Redex match is made of "bind"s that have nothing to do with our notion of binding.
