@title{The Redex Reference}

To load Redex use: @defmodule*/no-declare[(redex)] which provides all of
the names documented in this library.

Alternatively, use the @racketmodname[redex/reduction-semantics] and 
@racketmodname[redex/pict] modules, which provide only non-GUI 
functionality (i.e., everything except @racketmodname[redex/gui]), 
making them suitable for programs which should not depend on 
@racketmodname[racket/gui/base].

@section{Patterns}

@defmodule*/no-declare[(redex/reduction-semantics)]
@declare-exporting[redex/reduction-semantics redex]

This section covers Redex's @deftech{pattern} language, used in many
of Redex's forms.

Note that pattern matching is caching (including caching the results
of side-conditions). This means that once a pattern has matched a
given term, Redex assumes that it will always match that term. 

This is the grammar for the Redex pattern language. Non-terminal
references are wrapped with angle brackets; otherwise identifiers
in the grammar are terminals.

@item{The @defpattech[boolean] @pattern matches @racket[#true] and @racket[#false]
(which are the same as @racket[#t] and @racket[#f], respectively).
This @pattern may also be suffixed with an underscore and another

This @pattern may also be suffixed with an underscore and another
identifier, in which case they bind the full name (as if it
were an implicit @pattech[name] @pattern) and match the portion
before the underscore.
}

@item{The @defpattech[variable-except] @pattern matches any symbol except those
listed in its argument. This is useful for ensuring that
keywords in the language are not accidentally captured by
variables. 
}

@item{ The @defpattech[variable-prefix] @pattern matches any symbol
that begins with the given prefix. }

@item{The @defpattech[variable-not-otherwise-mentioned] @pattern matches any
symbol except those that are used as literals elsewhere in
the language.
}

@item{The @defpattech[hole] @pattern matches anything when inside
the first argument to an @pattech[in-hole] @|pattern|. Otherwise, 
it matches only a hole.
}

@item{The @defpattech[symbol] @pattern stands for a literal symbol that must
match exactly, unless it is the name of a non-terminal in a
relevant language or contains an underscore. 

If it is a non-terminal, it matches any of the right-hand
sides of that non-terminal. If the non-terminal appears
twice in a single pattern, then the match is constrained
to expressions that are the same, unless the pattern is part
of a grammar, in which case there is no constraint.

If the symbol is a non-terminal followed by an underscore,
for example @tt{e_1}, it is implicitly the same as a name @pattern
that matches only the non-terminal, @tt{(@pattech[name] e_1 e)} for the
example. Accordingly, repeated uses of the same name are
constrained to match the same expression.

If the symbol is a non-terminal followed by @tt{_!_}, for example
@tt{e_!_1}, it is also treated as a @|pattern|, but repeated uses of
the same @pattern are constrained to be different. For
example, this @|pattern|:

@racketblock[(e_!_1 e_!_1 e_!_1)]

matches lists of three @tt{e}s, but where all three of them are
distinct.

If the @tt{_!_} is used under the ellipsis then the ellipsis is effectively
ignored. That is, a pattern like this:

@racketblock[(e_!_1 ... e_!_1)]

matches all sequences of @racket[e]s that have at least one element and are
all distinct.

Unlike a @tt{_} @|pattern|, the @tt{_!_} @|pattern|s do not bind names.

If @tt{_} names and @tt{_!_} are mixed, they are treated as
separate. That is, this @pattern @tt{(e_1 e_!_1)} matches just the
same things as @tt{(e e)}, but the second doesn't bind any
variables.

If the symbol otherwise has an underscore, it is an error.
}

@item{The @pattern @tt{(@defpattech[name] symbol @ttpattern)}
matches @ttpattern and binds using it to the name @tt{symbol}. 
}

@item{The @tt{(@defpattech[in-hole] @ttpattern @ttpattern)} @pattern
matches the first @|ttpattern|. This match must include exactly one match
against the second @|ttpattern|. If there are zero matches or more
than one match, an exception is raised.

When matching the first argument of in-hole, the @racket[hole] @pattern
matches any sexpression. Then, the sexpression that matched the hole
@pattern is used to match against the second @|pattern|.
}

@item{The @tt{(@defpattech[hide-hole] @ttpattern)} @pattern matches what
the embedded @ttpattern matches but if the @pattern matcher is
looking for a decomposition, it ignores any holes found in
that @|ttpattern|.
}

@item{The @tt{(@defpattech[side-condition] @ttpattern guard)} @pattern
matches what the embedded @ttpattern matches, and then the guard
expression is evaluated. If it returns @racket[#f], the @pattern fails
to match, and if it returns anything else, the @pattern matches. Any
occurrences of @racket[name] in the @pattern (including those implicitly
there via @tt{_} patterns) are bound using @racket[term-let] in the
guard. 
}

@item{The @tt{(@defpattech[cross] symbol)} @pattern is used for the compatible
closure functions. If the language contains a non-terminal with the
same name as @racket[symbol], the @pattern @racket[(cross symbol)] matches the
context that corresponds to the compatible closure of that
non-terminal.
}

@item{The @tt{(@defpattech[pattern-sequence] ...)}
@pattern matches a sexpression
list, where each pattern-sequence element matches an element
of the list. In addition, if a list @pattern contains an
ellipsis, the ellipsis is not treated as a literal, instead
it matches any number of duplicates of the @pattern that
came before the ellipses (including 0). Furthermore, each
@tt{(@pattech[name] symbol @ttpattern)} in the duplicated @pattern binds a
list of matches to @tt{symbol}, instead of a single match.  (A
nested duplicated @pattern creates a list of list matches,
etc.) Ellipses may be placed anywhere inside the row of
@|pattern|s, except in the first position or immediately after
another ellipses.

Multiple ellipses are allowed. For example, this @|pattern|:

@racketblock[((name x a) ... (name y a) ...)]

matches this sexpression:

@racketblock[(@#,tttterm (a a))]

three different ways. One where the first @tt{a} in the @pattern
matches nothing, and the second matches both of the
occurrences of @tt{a}, one where each named @pattern matches a
single @tt{a} and one where the first matches both and the
second matches nothing.

If the ellipses is named (i.e., has an underscore and a name
following it, like a variable may), the @pattern matcher
records the length of the list and ensures that any other
occurrences of the same named ellipses must have the same
length. 

As an example, this @|pattern|:

@racketblock[((name x a) ..._1 (name y a) ..._1)]

only matches this sexpression:

@racketblock[(@#,tttterm (a a))]

one way, with each named @pattern matching a single a. Unlike
the above, the two @|pattern|s with mismatched lengths is ruled
out, due to the underscores following the ellipses.

Also, like underscore @|pattern|s above, if an underscore
@pattern begins with @tt{..._!_}, then the lengths must be
different.

Thus, with the @|pattern|:

@racketblock[((name x a) ..._!_1 (name y a) ..._!_1)]

and the expression

@racketblock[(@#,tttterm (a a))]

two matches occur, one where @tt{x} is bound to @racket['()] and
@tt{y} is bound to @racket['(a a)] and one where @tt{x} is bound to
@racket['(a a)] and @tt{y} is
bound to @racket['()].

If @racket[redex-match] receives three arguments, it
matches the pattern (in the language) against its third
argument. If it matches, this returns a list of match
structures describing the matches (see @racket[match?] and 
@racket[match-bindings]). If it fails, it returns
@racket[#f].

If @racket[redex-match] receives only two arguments, it
builds a procedure for efficiently testing if expressions
match the pattern, using the language @racket[lang]. The
procedures accepts a single expression and if the expression
matches, it returns a list of match structures describing the

@section{Terms}

@declare-exporting[redex/reduction-semantics redex]

Object language expressions in Redex are written using
@racket[term]. It is similar to Racket's @racket[quote] (in
many cases it is identical) in that it constructs lists as
the visible representation of terms. 

The grammar of @deftech{term}s is (note that an ellipsis
stands for repetition unless otherwise indicated):

@(racketgrammar* #:literals (in-hole hole unquote unquote-splicing) 
   [term identifier
         (term-sequence ...)
         ,racket-expression
         (in-hole term term)
         hole
         #t #f
         string]
   [term-sequence 
     term
     ,@racket-expression
     (code:line ... (code:comment "literal ellipsis"))])

@itemize[

@item{A term written @racket[_identifier] is equivalent to the
corresponding symbol, unless the identifier is bound by
@racket[term-let], @racket[define-term], or a @|pattern| variable or
the identifier is @tt{hole} (as below).}

@item{A term written @racket[(_term-sequence ...)] constructs a list of
the terms constructed by the sequence elements.}

@item{A term written @racket[,_racket-expression] evaluates the
@racket[racket-expression] and substitutes its value into the term at
that point.}

@item{A term written @racket[,@_racket-expression] evaluates the
@racket[racket-expression], which must produce a list. It then splices
the contents of the list into the expression at that point in the sequence.}

@item{A term written @racket[(in-hole #,tttterm #,tttterm)]
 is the dual to the @pattern @racket[in-hole] -- it accepts
 a context and an expression and uses @racket[plug] to combine
them.}

@item{A term written @racket[hole] produces a hole.}

@item{A term written as a literal boolean or a string
produces the boolean or the string.}
]

@defform*[[(term @#,tttterm) (term @#,tttterm #:lang lang-id)]]{

Used for construction of a term.

It behaves similarly to @racket[quasiquote], except for a few special
forms that are recognized (listed below) and that names bound by
@racket[term-let] are implicitly substituted with the values that
those names were bound to, expanding ellipses as in-place sublists (in
the same manner as syntax-case patterns).

The optional @racket[#:lang] keyword must supply an identifier bound
by @racket[define-language], and adds a check that any symbol containing
an underscore in @tttterm could have been bound by a pattern in the
language referenced by @racket[lang-id].  In practice, this means that the
underscore must be preceded by a non-terminal in that language or a
built-in @ttpattern such as @racket[number].  This form of @racket[term]
is used internally by default, so this check is applied to terms 
that are constructed by Redex forms such as @racket[reduction-relation] 
and @racket[define-metafunction].

For example,

@racketblock[
(term-let ([body '(+ x 1)]
           [(expr ...) '(+ - (values * /))]
           [((id ...) ...) '((a) (b) (c d))])
  (term (let-values ([(id ...) expr] ...) body)))
]

evaluates to

@racketblock[
'(let-values ([(a) +] 
              [(b) -] 
              [(c d) (values * /)]) 
   (+ x 1))
]

It is an error for a term variable to appear in an
expression with an ellipsis-depth different from the depth
with which it was bound by @racket[term-let]. It is also an error
for two @racket[term-let]-bound identifiers bound to lists of
different lengths to appear together inside an ellipsis.
}

@defidform[hole]{ Recognized specially within
  @racket[term]. A @racket[hole] form is an

  error elsewhere.  }

@defform/subs[(term-let ([tl-pat expr] ...) body)

               [tl-pat-ele tl-pat (code:line tl-pat ... (code:comment "a literal ellipsis"))])]{

Matches each given id pattern to the value yielded by
evaluating the corresponding expression and binds each variable in
the id pattern to the appropriate value (described
below). These bindings are then accessible to the @|tttterm|
syntactic form.

Note that each ellipsis should be the literal symbol consisting of
three dots (and the ... elsewhere indicates repetition as usual). If
@racket[tl-pat] is an identifier, it matches any value and binds it to
the identifier, for use inside @racket[term]. If it is a list, it
matches only if the value being matched is a list value and only if
every subpattern recursively matches the corresponding list
element. There may be a single ellipsis in any list pattern; if one is
present, the pattern before the ellipses may match multiple adjacent
elements in the list value (possibly none).

This form is a lower-level form in Redex, and not really designed to
be used directly. For @racket[let]-like forms that use
Redex's full pattern matching facilities, see @racket[redex-let],

This form defines the grammar of a language. It allows the
definition of recursive @|pattern|s, much like a BNF, but for
regular-tree grammars. It goes beyond their expressive
power, however, because repeated @racket[name] @|pattern|s and
side-conditions can restrict matches in a context-sensitive
way.

A @racket[non-terminal-def] comprises one or more non-terminal names
(considered aliases) followed by one or more productions.

For example, the following defines @deftech{@racket[_lc-lang]} as the
grammar of the λ-calculus:

@racketblock[
  (define-language lc-lang
    (e (e e ...)
       x
       v)
    (c (v ... c e ...)
       hole)
    (v (λ (x ...) e))
    (x variable-not-otherwise-mentioned))
]

with non-terminals @racket[e] for the expression language, @racket[x] for
variables, @racket[c] for the evaluation contexts and @racket[v] for values.
}

A non-terminal's names and productions may be separated by the keyword @racket[::=].
Use of the @racket[::=] keyword outside a language definition is a syntax error.

This form extends a language with some new, replaced, or
extended non-terminals. For example, this language:

@racketblock[
  (define-extended-language lc-num-lang
    lc-lang
    (v ....     (code:comment "extend the previous `v' non-terminal")
       number
       +)
    (x (variable-except λ +)))
]

extends @racket[_lc-lang] with two new alternatives (@racket[+] and @racket[number])
for the @racket[v] non-terminal, carries forward the @racket[e] 
and @racket[c] non-terminals, and replaces the @racket[x] non-terminal 
with a new one (which happens to be equivalent to the one that would 
have been inherited).

The four-period ellipses indicates that the new language's
non-terminal has all of the alternatives from the original
language's non-terminal, as well as any new ones. If a
non-terminal occurs in both the base language and the
extension, the extension's non-terminal replaces the
originals. If a non-terminal only occurs in either the base
language, then it is carried forward into the
extension. And, of course, extend-language lets you add new
non-terminals to the language.

If a language is has a group of multiple non-terminals
defined together, extending any one of those non-terminals
extends all of them.

  Constructs a language that is the union of all of the
  languages listed in the @racket[base/prefix-lang].
  
  If the two languages have non-terminals in common, then 
  @racket[define-union-language] will combine all of the productions
  of the common non-terminals. For example, this definition of @racket[L]:
  @racketblock[(define-language L1
                 (e ::=
                    (+ e e) 
                    number))
               (define-language L2
                 (e ::=
                    (if e e e)
                    true 
                    false))
               (define-union-language L1-plus-L2 L1 L2)]
  is equivalent to this one:
  @racketblock[(define-language L1-plus-L2
                 (e ::=
                    (+ e e)

                    true 
                    false))]
  
  If a language has a prefix, then all of the non-terminals
  from that language have the corresponding prefix in 
  the union language. The prefix helps avoid unintended collisions
  between the constituent language's non-terminals.
  
  For example, with two these two languages:
  @racketblock[(define-language UT
                 (e (e e)
                    (λ (x) e)

               (define-language WT
                 (e (e e)
                    (λ (x t) e)
                    x)
                 (t (→ t t)
                    num))]
  then this declaration:
  @racketblock[(define-union-language B (ut. UT) (wt. WT))]
  will create a language named @racket[B] containing the non-terminals
  @racket[ut.e], @racket[wt.e], and @racket[wt.t] consisting
  of the productions listed in the original languages.
}

                         @#,tttterm])]{

Defines a reduction relation case-wise, one case for each of the
@racket[reduction-case] clauses. 

The optional @racket[domain] clause provides a contract for the
relation, in the form of a pattern that defines the relation's 
domain and codomain.

The @racket[arrow-name] in each @racket[reduction-case] clause is either 
@racket[base-arrow-name] (default @racket[-->]) or an arrow name
defined by @racket[shortcuts] (described below). In either case, 
the @|pattern| refers to @racket[language] and binds variables in
the corresponding @|tterm|. Following the @|pattern| and @|tterm|
can be the name of the reduction rule and declarations of fresh
variables and side-conditions.

For example, the expression

@racketblock[
  (reduction-relation
   lc-lang
   (--> (in-hole c_1 ((λ (variable_i ...) e_body) v_i ...))
        (in-hole c_1 ,(foldl lc-subst 
                             (term e_body) 
                             (term (v_i ...)) 
                             (term (variable_i ...))))
        beta-v))
]

defines a reduction relation for the @tech{@racket[_lc-lang]} grammar.

A rule's name (used in @seclink["Typesetting" "typesetting"],
the @racket[stepper], @racket[traces], and 
@racket[apply-reduction-relation/tag-with-names]) can be given
as a literal (an identifier or a string) or as an expression
that computes a name using the values of the bound pattern
variables (much like the rule's right-hand side). Some operations
require literal names, so a rule definition may provide both
a literal name and a computed name. In particular, only rules that include
a literal name may be replaced using @racket[extend-reduction-relation],
used as breakpoints in the @racket[stepper], and selected using
@racket[render-reduction-relation-rules]. The output of 
@racket[apply-reduction-relation/tag-with-names], @racket[traces], and
the @racket[stepper] prefers the computed name, if it exists. Typesetting
a rule with a computed name shows the expression that computes the name
only when the rule has no literal name or when it would not typeset in 
pink due to @racket[with-unquote-rewriter]s in the context; otherwise,
the literal name (or nothing) is shown.

Fresh variable clauses generate variables that do not
occur in the term being reduced. If the @racket[fresh-clause] is a
variable, that variable is used both as a binding in the
@|tterm| and as the prefix for the freshly generated
variable. (The variable does not have to be
a non-terminal in the language of the reduction relation.)

The second form of @racket[fresh-clause]s generates 
a sequence of variables. In that case, the ellipses
are literal ellipses; that is, you must actually write
ellipses in your rule. The variable @racket[var1] is like the
variable in first case of a @racket[fresh-clause]; namely it is
used to determine the prefix of the generated variables and
it is bound in the right-hand side of the reduction rule,
but unlike the single-variable fresh clause, it is bound to
a sequence of variables. The variable @racket[var2] is used to
determine the number of variables generated and @racket[var2] must be
bound by the left-hand side of the rule.

The expressions within @as-index{@racket[side-condition] clause}s
and @as-index{@racket[side-condition/hidden] clause}s are collected with @racket[and] and
used as guards on the case being matched. The argument to each
side-condition should be a Racket expression, and the pattern
variables in the @|ttpattern| are bound in that expression. A
@racket[side-condition/hidden] clause is the same as
a @racket[side-condition] clause, except that the condition is not
rendered when typesetting via @racketmodname[redex/pict].

Each @deftech{@racket[where] clause} acts as a side condition requiring a
successful pattern match, and it can bind pattern variables in the
side-conditions (and @racket[where] clauses) that follow and in the
metafunction result. The bindings are the same as bindings in a
@racket[term-let] expression. A @as-index{@racket[where/hidden] clause} is the
same as a @racket[where] clause, but the clause is not
rendered when typesetting via @racketmodname[redex/pict].

Each @racket[judgment-holds] clause acts like a @racket[where] clause, where
the left-hand side pattern incorporates each of the patterns used in the 
judgment form's output positions.

Each @racket[shortcut] clause defines arrow names in terms of 
@racket[base-arrow-name] and earlier @racket[shortcut] definitions.
The left- and right-hand sides of a @racket[shortcut] definition 
are identifiers, not @|pattern|s and @|tterm|s. These identifiers
need not correspond to non-terminals in @racket[language].

For example, this expression

@racketblock[
  (reduction-relation
   lc-num-lang
   (==> ((λ (variable_i ...) e_body) v_i ...)
        ,(foldl lc-subst 
                (term e_body) 
                (term (v_i ...)) 
                (term (variable_i ...))))
   (==> (+ number_1 ...)
        ,(apply + (term (number_1 ...))))
   
   with
   [(--> (in-hole c_1 a) (in-hole c_1 b))
    (==> a b)])
]
  
defines reductions for the λ-calculus with numbers,
where the @tt{==>} shortcut is defined by reducing in the context
@tt{c}.

A @racket[fresh] clause in @racket[reduction-case] defined by shortcut
refers to the entire term, not just the portion matched by the left-hand
side of shortcut's use.

If there are infinite reduction
sequences that do not repeat, this function will not
terminate (it does terminate if the only infinite reduction paths are cyclic).

If the @racket[cache-all?] argument is @racket[#t], then @racket[apply-reduction-relation*]
keeps a cache of all visited terms when traversing the graph and does not revisit
any of them. This cache can, in some cases, use a lot of memory, so it is off by
default and the cycle checking happens by keeping track only of the current path
it is traversing through the reduction graph.

The @racket[stop-when] argument controls the stopping criterion. Specifically, it is
called with each term that @racket[apply-reduction-relation*] encounters. If it
ever returns a true value (anything except @racket[#f]), then @racket[apply-reduction-relation*]
considers the term to be irreducible (and so returns it and does not try to
reduce it further).

The @racket[define-metafunction] form builds a function on
sexpressions according to the pattern and right-hand-side
expressions. The first argument indicates the language used
to resolve non-terminals in the pattern expressions. Each of
the rhs-expressions is implicitly wrapped in @|tttterm|. 

The contract, if present, is matched against every input to
the metafunction and, if the match fails, an exception is raised.
If present, the term inside the @racket[maybe-pre-condition] is evaluated
after a successful match to the input pattern in the contract (with
any variables from the input contract bound). If
it returns @racket[#f], then the input contract is considered to not
have matched and an error is also raised. When a metafunction
returns, the expression in the @racket[maybe-post-condition] is
evaluated (if present), with any variables from the input or output 
contract bound.

The @racket[side-condition], @racket[hidden-side-condition],
@racket[where], and @racket[where/hidden] clauses behave as
in the @racket[reduction-relation] form.

The resulting metafunction raises an exception recognized by @racket[exn:fail:redex?] if
no clauses match or if one of the clauses matches multiple ways
(and that leads to different results for the different matches).

The @racket[side-condition] extra is evaluated after a successful match
to the corresponding argument pattern. If it returns @racket[#f],
the clause is considered not to have matched, and the next one is tried.
The @racket[side-condition/hidden] extra behaves the same, but is
not typeset.

The @racket[where] and @racket[where/hidden] extra are like
@racket[side-condition] and @racket[side-condition/hidden],
except the match guards the clause.

The @racket[judgment-holds] clause is like @racket[side-condition]
and @racket[where], except the given judgment must hold for the
clause to be taken.

The @racket[clause-name] is used only when typesetting. See
@racket[metafunction-cases].

Note that metafunctions are assumed to always return the same results
for the same inputs, and their results are cached, unless
@racket[caching-enabled?] is set to @racket[#f]. Accordingly, if a
metafunction is called with the same inputs twice, then its body is
only evaluated a single time.

As an example, these metafunctions finds the free variables in
an expression in the @racket[_lc-lang] above:

@racketblock[
    (define-metafunction lc-lang
      free-vars : e -> (x ...)
      [(free-vars (e_1 e_2 ...))
       (∪ (free-vars e_1) (free-vars e_2) ...)]
      [(free-vars x) (x)]
      [(free-vars (λ (x ...) e))
       (- (free-vars e) (x ...))])
]

The first argument to define-metafunction is the grammar
(defined above). Following that are three cases, one for
each variation of expressions (e in @racket[_lc-lang]). The free variables of an
application are the free variables of each of the subterms;
the free variables of a variable is just the variable
itself, and the free variables of a λ expression are
the free variables of the body, minus the bound parameters.

Here are the helper metafunctions used above.

@racketblock[
    (define-metafunction lc-lang
      ∪ : (x ...) ... -> (x ...)
      [(∪ (x_1 ...) (x_2 ...) (x_3 ...) ...)
       (∪ (x_1 ... x_2 ...) (x_3 ...) ...)]
      [(∪ (x_1 ...))
       (x_1 ...)]
      [(∪) ()])
    
    (define-metafunction lc-lang
      - : (x ...) (x ...) -> (x ...)
      [(- (x ...) ()) (x ...)]
      [(- (x_1 ... x_2 x_3 ...) (x_2 x_4 ...))
       (- (x_1 ... x_3 ...) (x_2 x_4 ...))
       (side-condition (not (memq (term x_2) (term (x_3 ...)))))]
      [(- (x_1 ...) (x_2 x_3 ...))
       (- (x_1 ...) (x_3 ...))])
]

Note the side-condition in the second case of @racket[-]. It
ensures that there is a unique match for that case. Without
it, @racket[(term (- (x x) x))] would lead to an ambiguous
match.

The @racket[or] clause is used to define a form of conditional
right-hand side of a metafunction. In particular, if any of the
@racket[where] or @racket[side-condition] clauses fail, then
evaluation continues after an @racket[or] clause, treating the
term that follows as the result (subject to any subsequent
@racket[where] clauses or @racket[side-condition]s. This construction
is equivalent to simply duplicating the left-hand side of the
clause, once for each @racket[or] expression, but signals to
the typesetting library to use a large left curly brace to group
the conditions in the @racket[or].

Defines a metafunction @racket[g] as an extension of an existing

                      etc.])]{
Defines @racket[form-id] as a relation on terms via a set of inference rules.
Each rule must be such that its premises can be evaluated left-to-right
without ``guessing'' values for any of their pattern variables. Redex checks this
property using the mandatory @racket[mode-spec] declaration, which partitions positions
into inputs @racket[I] and outputs @racket[O]. Output positions in conclusions
and input positions in premises must be @|tttterm|s; input positions in conclusions and 
output positions in premises must be @|ttpattern|s. When the optional @racket[contract-spec] 
declaration is present, Redex dynamically checks that the terms flowing through
these positions match the provided patterns, raising an exception recognized by 
@racket[exn:fail:redex] if not. The term in the optional @racket[invariant-spec] is
evaluated after the output positions have been computed and the contract has matched
successfully, with variables from the contract bound; a result of @racket[#f] is
considered to be a contract violation and an exception is raised.

For example, the following defines addition on natural numbers:
@interaction[
#:eval redex-eval
       (define-language nats
         (n ::= z (s n)))
       (define-judgment-form nats
         #:mode (sum I I O)
         #:contract (sum n n n)
         [-----------  "zero"
          (sum z n n)]
         
         [(sum n_1 n_2 n_3)
          ------------------------- "add1"
          (sum (s n_1) n_2 (s n_3))])]

The @racket[judgment-holds] form checks whether a relation holds for any 
assignment of pattern variables in output positions.
@examples[
#:eval redex-eval
       (judgment-holds (sum (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s z)))))
       (judgment-holds (sum (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s n)))))
       (judgment-holds (sum (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s (s n))))))]
Alternatively, this form constructs a list of terms based on the satisfying
pattern variable assignments.
@examples[
#:eval redex-eval
       (judgment-holds (sum (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s n)))) n)
       (judgment-holds (sum (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s (s n))))) n)
       (judgment-holds (sum (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s n)))) (s n))]

Declaring different modes for the same inference rules enables different forms
of computation. For example, the following mode allows @racket[judgment-holds]
to compute all pairs with a given sum.
@interaction[
#:eval redex-eval
       (define-judgment-form nats
         #:mode (sumr O O I)
         #:contract (sumr n n n)
         [------------
          (sumr z n n)]
         
         [(sumr n_1 n_2 n_3)
          --------------------------
          (sumr (s n_1) n_2 (s n_3))])
       (judgment-holds (sumr n_1 n_2 (s (s z))) (n_1 n_2))]

A rule's @racket[where] and @racket[where/hidden] premises behave as in 
@racket[reduction-relation] and @racket[define-metafunction].
@examples[
#:eval redex-eval
       (define-judgment-form nats
         #:mode (le I I)
         #:contract (le n n)
         [--------
          (le z n)]
         
         [(le n_1 n_2)
          --------------------
          (le (s n_1) (s n_2))])
       (define-metafunction nats
         pred : n -> n or #f
         [(pred z) #f]
         [(pred (s n)) n])
       (define-judgment-form nats
         #:mode (gt I I)
         #:contract (gt n n)
         [(where n_3 (pred n_1))
          (le n_2 n_3)
          ----------------------
          (gt n_1 n_2)])
       (judgment-holds (gt (s (s z)) (s z)))
       (judgment-holds (gt (s z) (s z)))]

A rule's @racket[side-condition] and @racket[side-condition/hidden] premises are similar
to those in @racket[reduction-relation] and @racket[define-metafunction], except that
they do not implicitly unquote their right-hand sides. In other words, a premise 
of the form @racket[(side-condition term)] is equivalent to the premise 
@racket[(where #t term)], except it does not typeset with the ``#t = '', as that would.

Judgments with exclusively @racket[I] mode positions may also be used in @|tttterm|s
in a manner similar to metafunctions, and evaluate to a boolean.
@examples[
#:eval redex-eval
       (term (le (s z) (s (s z))))
       (term (le (s z) z))]

A literal ellipsis may follow a judgment premise when a template in one of the
judgment's input positions contains a pattern variable bound at ellipsis-depth
one.
@examples[
#:eval redex-eval
       (define-judgment-form nats
         #:mode (even I)
         #:contract (even n)
         
         [-------- "evenz"
          (even z)]
         
         [(even n)
          ---------------- "even2"
          (even (s (s n)))])
       
       (define-judgment-form nats
         #:mode (all-even I)
         #:contract (all-even (n ...))
         [(even n) ...
          ------------------
          (all-even (n ...))])
       (judgment-holds (all-even (z (s (s z)) z)))
       (judgment-holds (all-even (z (s (s z)) (s z))))]

Redex evaluates premises depth-first, even when it doing so leads to 
non-termination. For example, consider the following definitions:
@interaction[
#:eval redex-eval
       (define-language vertices
         (v a b c))
       (define-judgment-form vertices
         #:mode (edge I O)
         #:contract (edge v v)
         [(edge a b)]
         [(edge b c)])
       (define-judgment-form vertices
         #:mode (path I I)
         #:contract (path v v)
         [----------
          (path v v)]
         
         [(path v_2 v_1)
          --------------
          (path v_1 v_2)]
         
         [(edge v_1 v_2)
          (path v_2 v_3)
          --------------
          (path v_1 v_3)])]
Due to the second @racket[path] rule, the follow query fails to terminate:
@racketinput[(judgment-holds (path a c))]

Similar to @racket[define-judgment-form] but suitable only when every position

@racket[judgment-holds]; querying the result uses the same syntax as 
metafunction application.

The contract specification for a relation restricts the patterns that can
be used as input to a relation. For each argument to the relation, there
should be a single pattern, using @racket[x] or @racket[×] to separate
the argument contracts.

                 The @racket[real] base type enumeration consists of all integers and flonums, and the
                 @racket[number] pattern consists of complex numbers with real and imaginary parts 
                 taken from the @racket[real] enumeration.

                 The @racket[string] enumeration produces all single character strings before

                 the lowercase Latin characters, then uppercase Latin, and then every remaining
                 Unicode character. The @racket[variable] enumeration is the same, except it 
                 produces symbols instead of strings.

                 @racket[variable-not-otherwise-mentioned] are defined
                 similarly, as you expect.
                 
                 @examples[#:eval

                             (generate-term L unused #:i-th i))]

                 Finally, the @racket[any] pattern enumerates sexpressions of the above base types.
                 @examples[#:eval
                           redex-eval
                           (for/list ([i (in-range 20)])

                 In addition, all other pattern types are supported
                 except for mismatch repeat @racket[..._!_] patterns
                 and @racket[side-condition] patterns.
                 
                 The enumerators do not repeat terms unless the given pattern is ambiguous.
                 Roughly speaking, the enumerator generates all possible ways that a pattern
                 might be parsed and since ambiguous patterns have multiple ways they might
                 be parsed, those multiple parsings turn into repeated elements in the enumeration.
                 
                 @examples[#:eval
                           redex-eval
                           (for/list ([i (in-range 9)])
                             (generate-term L (boolean_1 ... boolean_2 ...) #:i-th i))]
                 
                 Other sources of ambiguity are @racket[in-hole] and overlapping non-terminals.
                 @examples[#:eval
                           redex-eval
                           (define-language L
                             (e ::= (e e) (λ (x) e) x)
                             (E ::= hole (e E) (E e))
                             (x ::= a b c))

                           (for/list ([i (in-range 9)])
                             (generate-term L (in-hole E e) #:i-th i))
                           
                           (define-language L
                             (overlap ::= natural integer))
                           (for/list ([i (in-range 10)])
                             (generate-term L overlap #:i-th i))]

                 For similar reasons, enumerations for mismatch
                 patterns (using @racketvarfont{_!_}) do not work properly when given 
                 ambiguous patterns; they may repeat elements of the enumeration.
                 @examples[#:eval
                           redex-eval
                           (define-language Bad

                           (generate-term Bad (ambig_!_1 ambig_!_1) #:i-th 4)]
                 In this case, the elements of the resulting list are the same,
                 even though they should not be, according to the pattern. Internally,
                 the enumerator has discovered two different ways to generate @racket[ambig]
                 (one where the @racket[x] comes from the first ellipses and one from the second)
                 but those two different ways produce the same term and so the enumerator
                 incorrectly produces @racket[(x x)].

                  The second form uses a more naive approach; it simply generates terms
                  that match the patterns of the cases of the metafunction; it does not
                  consider the results of the metafunctions, nor does it consider
                  patterns from earlier cases when generating terms based on a particular case.

                  the size and keywords arguments that may be more efficient if multiple

The argument @racket[size-expr] bounds the height of the generated term
(measured as the height of its parse tree). 

The optional keyword argument @racket[attempt-num-expr] 
(default @racket[1]) provides coarse grained control over the random
decisions made during generation; increasing @racket[attempt-num-expr]
tends to increase the complexity of the result. For example, the absolute
values of numbers chosen for @pattech[integer] patterns increase with
@racket[attempt-num-expr].

The random generation process does not actively consider the constraints
imposed by @pattech[side-condition] or @tt{_!_} @|pattern|s; instead, 
it uses a ``guess and check'' strategy in which it freely generates 
candidate terms then tests whether they happen to satisfy the constraints,
repeating as necessary. The optional keyword argument @racket[retries-expr]
(default @racket[100]) bounds the number of times that 
@racket[generate-term] retries the generation of any pattern. If 
@racket[generate-term] is unable to produce a satisfying term after 
@racket[retries-expr] attempts, it raises an exception recognized by
@racket[exn:fail:redex:generation-failure?].

                 alternates back and forth between in-order enumeration
                 and the ad hoc random generator. After the 10 minute mark,

                 uniformly at random; if it isn't, @racket[redex-check] uses a geometric
                 distribution with @racket[p-value] as its probability of zero

@racket[redex-check] generates at most @racket[attempts-expr] 
(default @racket[(default-check-attempts)])
random terms in its search. The size and complexity of these terms tend to increase 
with each failed attempt. The @racket[#:attempt-size] keyword determines the rate at which
terms grow by supplying a function that bounds term size based on the number of failed
attempts (see @racket[generate-term]'s @racket[size-expr] argument). By default, the bound
grows according to the @racket[default-attempt-size] function.

When @racket[print?-expr] produces any non-@racket[#f] value (the default), 
@racket[redex-check] prints the test outcome on @racket[current-output-port].
When @racket[print?-expr] produces @racket[#f], @racket[redex-check] prints
nothing, instead 
@itemlist[
  @item{returning a @racket[counterexample] structure when the test reveals a counterexample,}
  @item{returning @racket[#t] when all tests pass, or}
  @item{raising a @racket[exn:fail:redex:test] when checking the property raises an exception.}
]

The optional @racket[#:prepare] keyword supplies a function that transforms each
generated example before @racket[redex-check] checks @racket[property-expr].
This keyword may be useful when @racket[property-expr] takes the form
of a conditional, and a term chosen freely from the grammar is unlikely to
satisfy the conditional's hypothesis. In some such cases, the @racket[prepare] 
keyword  can be used to increase the probability that an example satisfies the
hypothesis.

The @racket[#:retries] keyword behaves identically as in @racket[generate-term],
controlling the number of times the generation of any pattern will be
reattempted. It can't be used together with @racket[#:satisfying].

If @racket[keep-going?-expr] produces any non-@racket[#f] value,
@racket[redex-check] will stop only when it hits the limit on the number of attempts 
showing all of the errors it finds. This argument is allowed only when 
@racket[print?-expr] is not @racket[#f].

When passed a metafunction or reduction relation via the optional @racket[#:source]
argument, @racket[redex-check] distributes its attempts across the left-hand sides
of that metafunction/relation by using those patterns, rather than @racket[pattern],
as the basis of its generation. It is an error if any left-hand side generates a
term that does not match @racket[pattern]. @racket[#:source] cannot be used
with @racket[#:satisfying].}

@deftech{Debugging PLT Redex Programs}

It is easy to write grammars and reduction rules that are
subtly wrong. Typically such mistakes result in examples
that get stuck when viewed in a @racket[traces] window.

The best way to debug such programs is to find an expression
that looks like it should reduce, but doesn't, then try to find
out which pattern is failing to match. To do so, use the
@racket[redex-match] form.

In particular, first check if the term in question matches the
your system's main non-terminal (typically the expression
or program non-terminal). If it does not match, simplify the term
piece by piece to determine whether the problem is in the
term or the grammar. 

If the term does match your system's main
non-terminal, determine by inspection which reduction rules
should apply. For each such rule, repeat the above term-pattern 
debugging procedure, this time using the rule's left-hand side 
pattern instead of the system's main non-terminal. In addition
to simplifying the term, also consider simplifying the pattern.

If the term matches the left-hand side, but the rule does not 
apply, then one of the rule's @racket[side-condition] or 
@racket[where] clauses is not satisfied. Using the bindings
reported by @racket[redex-match], check each @racket[side-condition]
expression and each @racket[where] pattern-match to discover which
clause is preventing the rule's application.

This function opens a new window and inserts each expression
in @racket[expr] (if @racket[multiple?] is @racket[#t] -- if
@racket[multiple?] is @racket[#f], then @racket[expr] is treated as a single
expression). Then, it reduces the terms until at least
@racket[reduction-steps-cutoff] (see below) different terms are
found, or no more reductions can occur. It inserts each new
term into the gui. Clicking the @onscreen{reduce} button reduces
until @racket[reduction-steps-cutoff] more terms are found.

The @racket[reduce] function applies the reduction relation to the terms.
By default, it is @racket[apply-reduction-relation/tag-with-names];
it may be changed to only return a subset of the possible reductions,
for example, but it must satisfy the same contract as
@racket[apply-reduction-relation/tag-with-names].

The @racket[pred] function indicates if a term has a particular
property. If it returns @racket[#f], the term is displayed with a
pink background. If it returns a string or a @racket[color%] object,
the term is displayed with a background of that color (using
@racket[the-color-database] to map the string to a color). If it
returns any other value, the term is displayed normally. If
the @racket[pred] function accepts two arguments, a term-node
corresponding to the term is passed to the predicate. This
lets the predicate function explore the (names of the)
reductions that led to this term, using @racket[term-node-children],
@racket[term-node-parents], and @racket[term-node-labels].

The @racket[pred] function may be called more than once per node. In
particular, it is called each time an edge is added to a
node. The latest value returned determines the color.

The @racket[pp] function is used to specially print expressions. It
must either accept one or four arguments. If it accepts one
argument, it will be passed each term and is expected to
return a string to display the term.

If the @racket[pp] function takes four arguments, it should render
its first argument into the port (its second argument) with
width at most given by the number (its third argument). The
final argument is the text where the port is connected --
characters written to the port go to the end of the editor.
Use @racket[write-special] to send @racket[snip%] objects or 
@racketmodname[2htdp/image] images 
(or other things that subscribe to @racketmodname[file/convertible]
or @racketmodname[pict/convert])
directly to the editor.

The @racket[colors] argument, if provided, specifies a list of
reduction-name/color-list pairs. The traces gui will color arrows
drawn because of the given reduction name with the given color instead
of using the default color.

The @racket[cdr] of each of the elements of @racket[colors] is a list
of colors, organized in pairs. The first two colors cover the colors
of the line and the border around the arrow head, the first when the
mouse is over a graph node that is connected to that arrow, and the
second for when the mouse is not over that arrow. Similarly, the next
colors are for the text drawn on the arrow and the last two are for
the color that fills the arrow head.  If fewer than six colors are
specified, the specified colors are used and then defaults are
filled in for the remaining colors.

The @racket[racket-colors?] argument (along with @racket[scheme-colors?],
retained for backward compatibility), controls the coloring of 
each window. When @racket[racket-colors?] is @racket[#t] (and
@racket[scheme-colors?] is @racket[#t] too), @racket[traces] colors the 
contents according to DrRacket's Racket-mode color scheme; otherwise,
@racket[traces] uses a black color scheme.

The @racket[term-filter] function is called each time a new node is
about to be inserted into the graph. If the filter returns false, the
node is not inserted into the graph.

The @racket[x-spacing] and @racket[y-spacing] arguments control the amount of
space put between the snips in the default layout.

The @racket[layout] argument is called (with all of the terms) when
new terms are inserted into the window. In general, it is called
after new terms are inserted in response to the user clicking on the
reduce button, and after the initial set of terms is inserted.
See also @racket[term-node-set-position!].

If @racket[edge-labels?] is @racket[#t] (the default), then edge labels
are drawn; otherwise not.

The @racket[edge-label-font] argument is used as the font on the edge
labels. If @racket[#f] is supplied, the @racket[dc<%>] object's default
font is used.

The traces library uses an instance of the @racketmodname[mrlib/graph]
library's @racket[graph-pasteboard<%>] interface to layout
the graphs.  Sometimes, overriding one of its methods can
help give finer-grained control over the layout, so the
@racket[graph-pasteboard-mixin] is applied to the class
before it is instantiated. Also note that all of the snips
inserted into the editor by this library have a
@tt{get-term-node} method which returns the snip's
@racket[term-node].

For a more serious example of @racket[traces], please see @secref["tutorial"],
but for a silly one that demonstrates how the @racket[pp] argument
lets us use images, we can take the pairing functions discussed in
Matthew Szudzik's @italic{An Elegant Pairing Function} presentation:
@racketblock[(define/contract (unpair z)
               (-> exact-nonnegative-integer? 
                   (list/c exact-nonnegative-integer? exact-nonnegative-integer?))
               (define i (integer-sqrt z))
               (define i2 (* i i))
               (cond
                 [(< (- z i2) i)
                  (list (- z i2) i)]
                 [else 
                  (list i (- z i2 i))]))
             
             (define/contract (pair x y)
               (-> exact-nonnegative-integer? exact-nonnegative-integer?
                   exact-nonnegative-integer?)
               (if (= x (max x y))
                   (+ (* x x) x y)
                   (+ (* y y) x)))]
and build a reduction relation out of them:
@racketblock[(define-language L (n ::= natural))
             (define red
               (reduction-relation
                L
                (--> (n_1 n_2)
                     ,(unpair (+ 1 (pair (term n_1) 
                                         (term n_2)))))))
             (traces red (term (0 0)))]
We can then turn those two numbers into two stars, where the
number indicates the number of points in the star:
@racketblock[(require 2htdp/image)
             (define/contract (two-stars point-count1 point-count2)
               (-> (>=/c 2) (>=/c 2) image?)
               (overlay
                (radial-star (+ 2 point-count1)
                             10 60
                             "solid"
                             (make-color 255 0 255 150))
                (radial-star (+ 2 point-count2)
                             10 60
                             "solid"
                             "cornflowerblue")))]
and then use the @racket[pp] function to show those in the
traces window instead of just the numbers.
@racketblock[(traces red 
                     (term (0 0))
                     #:pp
                     (λ (term port w txt)
                       (write-special 
                        (two-stars (+ 2 (list-ref term 0))
                                   (+ 2 (list-ref term 1)))
                        port)))]

@section{Typesetting}

@defmodule*/no-declare[(redex/pict)]
@declare-exporting[redex/pict redex]

The @racketmodname[redex/pict] library provides functions
designed to typeset grammars, reduction relations, and
metafunctions.

Each grammar, reduction relation, and metafunction can be
saved in a @filepath{.ps} file (as encapsulated PostScript),
or can be turned into a pict for viewing in the REPL or
using with Slideshow (see the @racketmodname[pict]
library).

For producing papers with Scribble, just include the
picts inline in the paper and pass the the @DFlag{dvipdf} 
flag generate the @filepath{.pdf} file. For producing
papers with LaTeX, create @filepath{.ps} files from Redex and use
@tt{latex} and @tt{dvipdf} to create @filepath{.pdf} files
(using @tt{pdflatex} with @filepath{.pdf} files will 
work but the results will not look as good onscreen).

@subsection{Picts, PDF, & PostScript}

This section documents two classes of operations, one for
direct use of creating postscript figures for use in papers
and for use in DrRacket to easily adjust the typesetting:
@racket[render-term],
@racket[render-language],
@racket[render-reduction-relation], 
@racket[render-relation],
@racket[render-judgment-form],
@racket[render-metafunctions], and
@racket[render-lw], 
and one for use in combination with other libraries
that operate on @racketmodname[pict]s
@racket[term->pict],
@racket[language->pict],
@racket[reduction-relation->pict],
@racket[relation->pict],
@racket[judgment-form->pict],
@racket[metafunction->pict], and
@racket[lw->pict].
The primary difference between these functions is that the former list
sets @racket[dc-for-text-size] and the latter does not.


@defform*[[(render-term lang term)
           (render-term lang term file)]]{
  Renders the term @racket[term]. If @racket[file] is @racket[#f] or not present,
  @racket[render-term] produces a pict; if @racket[file] is a path, it saves
  Encapsulated PostScript in the provided filename, unless the filename
  ends with @filepath{.pdf}, in which case it saves PDF.
  
  The @racket[term] argument must be a literal; it is not an 
  evaluated position. For example, this:
  @racketblock[(define-language L)
               (define x (term (+ 1 2)))
               (render-term L x)]

  See @racket[render-language] for more details on the construction of the pict.
}


@defform[(term->pict lang term)]{
 Produces a pict like @racket[render-term], but without
 adjusting @racket[dc-for-text-size].

 The first argument is expected to be a @racket[compiled-language?] and
 the second argument is expected to be a term (without the
 @racket[term] wrapper). The formatting in the @racket[term] argument
 is used to determine how the resulting pict will look.

These parameters determine the font used for various text in
the picts. See @racket[text] in the texpict collection for
documentation explaining @racket[text-style/c]. One of the more
useful things it can be is one of the symbols @racket['roman],
@racket['swiss], or @racket['modern], which are a serif, sans-serif, and
monospaced font, respectively. (It can also encode style
information, too.)

The @racket[label-style] is used for the reduction rule label
names. The @racket[literal-style] is used for names that aren't
non-terminals that appear in patterns. The
@racket[metafunction-style] is used for the names of
metafunctions. 
The @racket[paren-style] is used for the parentheses 
(including ``['', ``]'', ``@"{"'', and ``@"}"'',
as well as ``('' and ``)''), but not for the square brackets used for
in-hole decompositions, which use the @racket[default-style].
The @racket[grammar-style] is used for the ``::='' and ``|''
in grammars.

The @racket[non-terminal-style] parameter is used for the names of non-terminals.
Two parameters style the text in the (optional) "underscore" component
of a non-terminal reference. The first, @racket[non-terminal-subscript-style],
applies to the segment between the underscore and the first caret (@racket[^]) 
to follow it; the second, @racket[non-terminal-superscript-style], applies
to the segment following that caret. For example, in the non-terminal 
reference @racket[x_y^z], @racket[x] has style @racket[non-terminal-style],
@racket[y] has style @racket[non-terminal-subscript-style], and @racket[z]
has style @racket[non-terminal-superscript-style].

The @racket[default-style] is used for parenthesis, the dot in dotted
lists, spaces, the
"where" and "fresh" in side-conditions, and other places
where the other parameters aren't used.

@defparam[white-bracket-sizing proc (-> string? number? (values number? number? number? number?))]{

  This parameter is used when typesetting metafunctions to
  determine how to create the @"\u301a\u301b"

  (since glyphs tend not to be available in PostScript
  fonts), they are created by combining two ‘[’ characters
  or two ‘]’ characters together.
  
  The procedure accepts a string that is either @racket["["]

  numbers determine the offset (from the left and from the

  second two two numbers determine the extra space added (to
  the left and to the right respectively).

  The default value of the parameter is: @racketblock[

@subsection[#:tag "pink"]{Removing the Pink Background}

@declare-exporting[redex/pict redex]

When reduction rules, a metafunction, or a grammar contains
unquoted Racket code or side-conditions, they are rendered
with a pink background as a guide to help find them and
provide an alternative typesetting for them. In general, a
good goal for a PLT Redex program that you intend to typeset
is to only include such things when they correspond to
standard mathematical operations, and the Racket code is an
implementation of those operations.

To replace the pink code, use:

@defform[(with-unquote-rewriter proc expression)]{

Installs @racket[proc] as the current unquote rewriter and
evaluates @racket[expression]. If that expression computes any picts,
the unquote rewriter specified is used to remap them.

The @racket[proc] must match the contract @racket[(-> lw? lw?)].
Its result should be the rewritten version version of the input.
}

@defform[(with-atomic-rewriter name-symbol
                               string-or-thunk-returning-pict
                               expression)]{

This extends the current set of atomic-rewriters with one
new one that rewrites the value of name-symbol to
@racket[string-or-pict-returning-thunk] (applied, in the case of a
thunk), during the evaluation of expression.

@racket[name-symbol] is expected to evaluate to a symbol. The value
of @racket[string-or-thunk-returning-pict] is used whenever the symbol
appears in a pattern.
}

@defform[(with-compound-rewriter name-symbol
                                 proc
                                 expression)]{

This extends the current set of compound-rewriters with one
new one that rewrites the value of name-symbol via proc,
during the evaluation of expression.

@racket[name-symbol] is expected to evaluate to a symbol. The value
of proc is called with a @racket[(listof lw)], and is expected to
return a new @racket[(listof (or/c lw? string? pict?))],
rewritten appropriately. 

The list passed to the rewriter corresponds to the
@racket[lw] for the sequence that has name-symbol's value at
its head.

The result list is constrained to have at most 2 adjacent
non-@racket[lw]s. That list is then transformed by adding
@racket[lw] structs for each of the non-@racket[lw]s in the
list (see the text just below the description of @racket[lw] for a
explanation of logical space):

@itemize[
@item{
    If there are two adjacent @racket[lw]s, then the logical
    space between them is filled with whitespace.}

@item{
    If there is a pair of @racket[lw]s with just a single
    non-@racket[lw] between them, a @racket[lw] will be
    created (containing the non-@racket[lw]) that uses all
    of the available logical space between the @racket[lw]s.
}

@item{
    If there are two adjacent non-@racket[lw]s between two
    @racket[lw]s, the first non-@racket[lw] is rendered
    right after the first @racket[lw] with a logical space
    of zero, and the second is rendered right before the
    last @racket[lw] also with a logical space of zero, and
    the logical space between the two @racket[lw]s is
    absorbed by a new @racket[lw] that renders using no
    actual space in the typeset version.
}]

One useful way to take advantage of @racket[with-compound-rewriters]
is to return a list that begins and ends with @racket[""] (the
empty string). In that situation, any extra logical space that
would have been just outside the sequence is replaced with an 
@racket[lw] that does not draw anything at all.

}

@defform[(to-lw arg)]{

This form turns its argument into @racket[lw] structs that
contain all of the spacing information just as it would appear
when being used to typeset.

Each sub-expression corresponds to its own lw, and
the element indicates what kind of subexpression it is. If
the element is a list, then the lw corresponds to a
parenthesized sequence, and the list contains a lw
for the open paren, one lw for each component of the
sequence and then a lw for the close
parenthesis. In the case of a dotted list, there will also
be a lw in the third-to-last position for the dot.

For example, this expression:

@racketblock[(a)]

becomes this lw (assuming the above expression
appears as the first thing in the file):

@racketblock[
     (build-lw (list (build-lw "(" 0 0 0 1)
                     (build-lw 'a 0 0 1 1)
                     (build-lw ")" 0 0 2 1))
               0 0 0 3)
]

If there is some whitespace in the sequence, like this one:

@racketblock[
  (a b)
]

then there is no lw that corresponds to that
whitespace; instead there is a logical gap between the
lws.

@racketblock[
     (build-lw (list (build-lw "(" 0 0 0 1)
                     (build-lw 'a 0 0 1 1)
                     (build-lw 'b 0 0 3 1)
                     (build-lw ")" 0 0 4 1))
               0 0 0 5)
]

In general, identifiers are represented with symbols and
parenthesis are represented with strings and @racket[pict]s can be
inserted to render arbitrary pictures.

The line, line-span, column, and column-span correspond to
the logical spacing for the redex program, not the actual
spacing that will be used when they are rendered. The
logical spacing is only used when determining where to place
typeset portions of the program. In the absence of any
rewriters, these numbers correspond to the line and column
numbers in the original program.

The line and column are absolute numbers from the beginning
of the file containing the expression. The column number is
not necessarily the column of the open parenthesis in a
sequence -- it is the leftmost column that is occupied by
anything in the sequence. The line-span is the number of
lines, and the column span is the number of columns on the
last line (not the total width).

When there are multiple lines, lines are aligned based on
the logical space (i.e., the line/column &
line-span/column-span) fields of the lws. As an
example, if this is the original pattern:

@racketblock[
   (all good boys
        deserve fudge)
]

then the leftmost edges of the words "good" and "deserve"
will be lined up underneath each other, but the relative
positions of "boys" and "fudge" will be determined by the
natural size of the words as they rendered in the
appropriate font.

When @racket['spring] appears in the list in the @racket[e]
field of a @racket[lw] struct, then it absorbs all of the
space around it. It is also used by @racket[to-lw] when
constructing the picts for unquoted strings. For example, this expression

@racketblock[,x]

corresponds to these structs:

@racketblock[(build-lw (list (build-lw "" 1 0 9 0)
                             'spring
                             (build-lw x 1 0 10 1))
                       1 0 9 2)]

and the @racket['spring] causes there to be no space between
the empty string and the @racket[x] in the typeset output.

}

@defproc[(to-lw/stx [stx syntax?]) lw?]{
  This is the runtime variant on @racket[to-lw]; it accepts a 
  syntax object and returns the corresponding @racket[lw] structs.
  It only uses the location information in the syntax object,
