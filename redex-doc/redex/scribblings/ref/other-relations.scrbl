The @racket[define-metafunction] form builds a function on
terms according to the pattern and right-hand-side
expressions. The first argument indicates the language used
to resolve non-terminals in the pattern expressions. Each of
the rhs-expressions is implicitly wrapped in @|tttterm|. 

The contract, if present, is matched against every input to
the metafunction and, if the match fails, an exception is raised.
If a metavariable is repeated in a contract, it does not require
the terms to be equal, unless there is an underscore subscript
(i.e., the binding works like it does in @racket[define-language],
not how it works in the patterns in the left-hand sides of the metafunction
clauses).

If present, the term inside the @racket[maybe-pre-condition] is evaluated
after a successful match to the input pattern in the contract (with
any variables from the input contract bound). If
it returns @racket[#f], then the input contract is considered to not
have matched and an error is also raised. When a metafunction
returns, the expression in the @racket[maybe-post-condition] is
evaluated (if present), with any variables from the input or output 
contract bound.

The @racket[side-condition], @racket[hidden-side-condition],
@racket[where], and @racket[where/hidden] clauses behave as
in the @racket[reduction-relation] form.

The resulting metafunction raises an exception recognized by @racket[exn:fail:redex?] if
no clauses match or if one of the clauses matches multiple ways
(and that leads to different results for the different matches).

The @racket[side-condition] extra is evaluated after a successful match
to the corresponding argument pattern. If it returns @racket[#f],
the clause is considered not to have matched, and the next one is tried.
The @racket[side-condition/hidden] extra behaves the same, but is
not typeset.

The @racket[where] and @racket[where/hidden] extra are like
@racket[side-condition] and @racket[side-condition/hidden],
except the match guards the clause.

The @racket[judgment-holds] clause is like @racket[side-condition]
and @racket[where], except the given judgment must hold for the
clause to be taken.

The @racket[clause-name] is used only when typesetting. See
@racket[metafunction-cases].

The @racket[or] clause is used to define a form of conditional
right-hand side of a metafunction. In particular, if any of the
@racket[where] or @racket[side-condition] clauses fail, then
evaluation continues after an @racket[or] clause, treating the
term that follows as the result (subject to any subsequent
@racket[where] clauses or @racket[side-condition]s. This construction
is equivalent to simply duplicating the left-hand side of the
clause, once for each @racket[or] expression, but signals to
the typesetting library to use a large left curly brace to group
the conditions in the @racket[or].

Note that metafunctions are assumed to always return the same results
for the same inputs, and their results are cached, unless
@racket[caching-enabled?] is set to @racket[#f]. Accordingly, if a
metafunction is called with the same inputs twice, then its body is
only evaluated a single time.

As an example, these metafunctions finds the free variables in
an expression in the @racket[_lc-lang] above:

@racketblock[
    (define-metafunction lc-lang
      free-vars : e -> (x ...)
      [(free-vars (e_1 e_2 ...))
       (∪ (free-vars e_1) (free-vars e_2) ...)]
      [(free-vars x) (x)]
      [(free-vars (λ (x ...) e))
       (- (free-vars e) (x ...))])
]

The first argument to define-metafunction is the grammar
(defined above). Following that are three cases, one for
each variation of expressions (e in @racket[_lc-lang]). The free variables of an
application are the free variables of each of the subterms;
the free variables of a variable is just the variable
itself, and the free variables of a λ expression are
the free variables of the body, minus the bound parameters.

Here are the helper metafunctions used above.

@racketblock[
    (define-metafunction lc-lang
      ∪ : (x ...) ... -> (x ...)
      [(∪ (x_1 ...) (x_2 ...) (x_3 ...) ...)
       (∪ (x_1 ... x_2 ...) (x_3 ...) ...)]
      [(∪ (x_1 ...))
       (x_1 ...)]
      [(∪) ()])
    
    (define-metafunction lc-lang
      - : (x ...) (x ...) -> (x ...)
      [(- (x ...) ()) (x ...)]
      [(- (x_1 ... x_2 x_3 ...) (x_2 x_4 ...))
       (- (x_1 ... x_3 ...) (x_2 x_4 ...))
       (side-condition (not (memq (term x_2) (term (x_3 ...)))))]
      [(- (x_1 ...) (x_2 x_3 ...))
       (- (x_1 ...) (x_3 ...))])
]

Note the side-condition in the second case of @racket[-]. It
ensures that there is a unique match for that case. Without
it, @racket[(term (- (x x) x))] would lead to an ambiguous
match.

                      etc.])]{
Defines @racket[form-id] as a relation on terms via a set of inference rules.
Each rule must be such that its premises can be evaluated left-to-right
without ``guessing'' values for any of their pattern variables. Redex checks this
property using the mandatory @racket[mode-spec] declaration, which partitions positions
into inputs @racket[I] and outputs @racket[O]. Output positions in conclusions
and input positions in premises must be @|tttterm|s; input positions in conclusions and 
output positions in premises must be @|ttpattern|s. When the optional @racket[contract-spec] 
declaration is present, Redex dynamically checks that the terms flowing through
these positions match the provided patterns, raising an exception recognized by 
@racket[exn:fail:redex] if not. The term in the optional @racket[invariant-spec] is
evaluated after the output positions have been computed and the contract has matched
successfully, with variables from the contract bound; a result of @racket[#f] is
considered to be a contract violation and an exception is raised.

For example, the following defines addition on natural numbers:
@examples[#:label #f #:eval redex-eval
          (define-language nats
            (n ::= z (s n)))
          (define-judgment-form nats
            #:mode (sum I I O)
            #:contract (sum n n n)
            [-----------  "zero"
             (sum z n n)]
            
            [(sum n_1 n_2 n_3)
             ------------------------- "add1"
             (sum (s n_1) n_2 (s n_3))])]

The @racket[judgment-holds] form checks whether a relation holds for any 
assignment of pattern variables in output positions.
@examples[
#:eval redex-eval
       (judgment-holds (sum (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s z)))))
       (judgment-holds (sum (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s n)))))
       (judgment-holds (sum (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s (s n))))))]
Alternatively, this form constructs a list of terms based on the satisfying
pattern variable assignments.
@examples[
#:eval redex-eval
       (judgment-holds (sum (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s n)))) n)
       (judgment-holds (sum (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s (s n))))) n)
       (judgment-holds (sum (s (s z)) (s z) (s (s (s n)))) (s n))]

Declaring different modes for the same inference rules enables different forms
of computation. For example, the following mode allows @racket[judgment-holds]
to compute all pairs with a given sum.
 @examples[#:label #f #:eval redex-eval
           (define-judgment-form nats
             #:mode (sumr O O I)
             #:contract (sumr n n n)
             [------------
              (sumr z n n)]
             
             [(sumr n_1 n_2 n_3)
              --------------------------
              (sumr (s n_1) n_2 (s n_3))])
           (judgment-holds (sumr n_1 n_2 (s (s z))) (n_1 n_2))]

A rule's @racket[where] and @racket[where/hidden] premises behave as in 
@racket[reduction-relation] and @racket[define-metafunction].
@examples[
#:eval redex-eval
       (define-judgment-form nats
         #:mode (le I I)
         #:contract (le n n)
         [--------
          (le z n)]
         
         [(le n_1 n_2)
          --------------------
          (le (s n_1) (s n_2))])
       (define-metafunction nats
         pred : n -> n or #f
         [(pred z) #f]
         [(pred (s n)) n])
       (define-judgment-form nats
         #:mode (gt I I)
         #:contract (gt n n)
         [(where n_3 (pred n_1))
          (le n_2 n_3)
          ----------------------
          (gt n_1 n_2)])
       (judgment-holds (gt (s (s z)) (s z)))
       (judgment-holds (gt (s z) (s z)))]

A rule's @racket[side-condition] and @racket[side-condition/hidden] premises are similar
to those in @racket[reduction-relation] and @racket[define-metafunction], except that
they do not implicitly unquote their right-hand sides. In other words, a premise 
of the form @racket[(side-condition term)] is equivalent to the premise 
@racket[(where #t term)], except it does not typeset with the ``#t = '', as that would.

Judgments with exclusively @racket[I] mode positions may also be used in @|tttterm|s
in a manner similar to metafunctions, and evaluate to a boolean.
@examples[
#:eval redex-eval
       (term (le (s z) (s (s z))))
       (term (le (s z) z))]

A literal ellipsis may follow a judgment premise when a template in one of the
judgment's input positions contains a pattern variable bound at ellipsis-depth
one.
@examples[
#:eval redex-eval
       (define-judgment-form nats
         #:mode (even I)
         #:contract (even n)
         
         [-------- "evenz"
          (even z)]
         
         [(even n)
          ---------------- "even2"
          (even (s (s n)))])
       
       (define-judgment-form nats
         #:mode (all-even I)
         #:contract (all-even (n ...))
         [(even n) ...
          ------------------
          (all-even (n ...))])
       (judgment-holds (all-even (z (s (s z)) z)))
       (judgment-holds (all-even (z (s (s z)) (s z))))]

Redex evaluates premises depth-first, even when it doing so leads to 
non-termination. For example, consider the following definitions:
@examples[#:label #f #:eval redex-eval
          (define-language vertices
            (v a b c))
          (define-judgment-form vertices
            #:mode (edge I O)
            #:contract (edge v v)
            [(edge a b)]
            [(edge b c)])
          (define-judgment-form vertices
            #:mode (path I I)
            #:contract (path v v)
            [----------
             (path v v)]
            
            [(path v_2 v_1)
             --------------
             (path v_1 v_2)]
            
            [(edge v_1 v_2)
             (path v_2 v_3)
             --------------
             (path v_1 v_3)])]
Due to the second @racket[path] rule, the follow query fails to terminate:
@racketinput[(judgment-holds (path a c))]

Similar to @racket[define-judgment-form] but suitable only when every position
is an input. There is no associated form corresponding to 
@racket[judgment-holds]; querying the result uses the same syntax as 
metafunction application.

The contract specification for a relation restricts the patterns that can
be used as input to a relation. For each argument to the relation, there
should be a single pattern, using @racket[x] or @racket[×] to separate
the argument contracts.

@defparam[current-traced-metafunctions traced-metafunctions (or/c 'all (listof symbol?))]{

Controls which metafunctions are currently being traced. If it is
@racket['all], all of them are. Otherwise, the elements of the list
name the metafunctions to trace. 

The tracing looks just like the tracing done by the @racketmodname[racket/trace]
library, except that the first column printed by each traced call indicate
if this call to the metafunction is cached. Specifically, a @tt{c} is printed
in the first column if the result is just returned from the cache and a
space is printed if the metafunction call is actually performed.

Defaults to @racket['()].
