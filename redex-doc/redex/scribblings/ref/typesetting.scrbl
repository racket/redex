@defmodule*/no-declare[(redex/pict)]
@declare-exporting[redex/pict redex]

The @racketmodname[redex/pict] library provides functions
designed to typeset grammars, reduction relations, and
metafunctions.

Each grammar, reduction relation, and metafunction can be
saved in a @filepath{.ps} file (as encapsulated PostScript),
or can be turned into a pict for viewing in the REPL or
using with Slideshow (see the @racketmodname[pict]
library).

For producing papers with Scribble, just include the
picts inline in the paper and pass the @DFlag{dvipdf} 
flag to generate the @filepath{.pdf} file. For producing
papers with LaTeX, create @filepath{.ps} files from Redex and use
@tt{latex} and @tt{dvipdf} to create @filepath{.pdf} files
(using @tt{pdflatex} with @filepath{.pdf} files will 
work but the results will not look as good onscreen).

@section{Picts, PDF, & PostScript}

This section documents two classes of operations, one for
direct use of creating postscript figures for use in papers
and for use in DrRacket to easily adjust the typesetting:
@racket[render-term],
@racket[render-language],
@racket[render-reduction-relation], 
@racket[render-relation],
@racket[render-judgment-form],
@racket[render-metafunctions], and
@racket[render-lw], 
and one for use in combination with other libraries
that operate on @racketmodname[pict]s
@racket[term->pict],
@racket[language->pict],
@racket[reduction-relation->pict],
@racket[relation->pict],
@racket[judgment-form->pict],
@racket[metafunction->pict], and
@racket[lw->pict].
The primary difference between these functions is that the former list
sets @racket[dc-for-text-size] and the latter does not.


@defform*[[(render-term lang term)
           (render-term lang term file)]]{
  Renders the term @racket[term]. If @racket[file] is @racket[#f] or not present,
  @racket[render-term] produces a pict; if @racket[file] is a path, it saves
  Encapsulated PostScript in the provided filename, unless the filename
  ends with @filepath{.pdf}, in which case it saves PDF.
  
 @ex[(define-language nums
       (AE K
           (+ AE AE))
       (code:comment "binary constants")
       (K · (1 K) (0 K)))
     (render-term nums (+ (1 (0 (1 ·))) (+ (1 (1 (1 ·))) (1 (0 (0 ·))))))]

 The @racket[term] argument must be a literal; it is not an 
 evaluated position. For example:
 @ex[(let ([x (term (+ (1 (1 (1 ·))) (1 (0 (0 ·)))))])
       (render-term nums x))]
 but also see @racket[render-term/pretty-write].
 
 See @racket[render-language] for more details on the construction of the pict.

}


@defform[(term->pict lang term)]{
 Produces a pict like @racket[render-term], but without
 adjusting @racket[dc-for-text-size].

 The first argument is expected to be a @racket[compiled-lang?] and
 the second argument is expected to be a term (without the
 @racket[term] wrapper). The formatting in the @racket[term] argument
 is used to determine how the resulting pict will look.
 
 This function is primarily designed to be used with
 Slideshow or with other tools that combine @racketmodname[pict]s
 together.

  Like @racket[render-term], except that the @racket[term] argument is evaluated,
  and expected to return a term. Then, @racket[pretty-write] is used
  to determine where the line breaks go, using the @racket[width] argument
  as a maximum width (via @racket[pretty-print-columns]).

This parameter controls the style used by default for the reduction
relation. It can be @racket['horizontal], where the left and
right-hand sides of the reduction rule are beside each other or
@racket['vertical], where the left and right-hand sides of the
reduction rule are above each other.  The @racket['compact-vertical]
style moves the reduction arrow to the second line and uses less space
between lines.  The @racket['vertical-overlapping-side-conditions]
variant, the side-conditions don't contribute to the width of the
pict, but are just overlaid on the second line of each rule.  The
@racket['horizontal-left-align] style is like the @racket['horizontal]
style, but the left-hand sides of the rules are aligned on the left,
instead of on the right. The @racket['horizontal-side-conditions-same-line]
is like @racket['horizontal], except that side-conditions
are on the same lines as the rule, instead of on their own line below.

@defthing[reduction-rule-style/c contract?]{

A contract equivalent to

This parameter controls the style used for typesetting
metafunctions. The @racket['left-right] style means that the
results of calling the metafunction are displayed to the 
right of the arguments and the @racket['up-down] style means that
the results are displayed below the arguments.

The @racket['left-right/vertical-side-conditions] and
@racket['up-down/vertical-side-conditions] variants format side
conditions each on a separate line, instead of all on the same line.

The @racket['left-right/compact-side-conditions] and
@racket['up-down/compact-side-conditions] variants move side
conditions to separate lines to avoid making the rendered form wider
would be otherwise---except that the rendered form is allowed to be up
to the width specified by @racket[metafunction-fill-acceptable-width].

The @racket['left-right/beside-side-conditions] variant is like
@racket['left-right], except it puts the side-conditions on the 
same line, instead of on a new line below the case.

These parameters determine the font used for various text in
the picts. See @racket[text] in the texpict collection for
documentation explaining @racket[text-style/c]. One of the more
useful things a style can be is the symbol @racket['roman],
@racket['swiss], or @racket['modern], which corresponds to serif, sans-serif, and
monospaced font, respectively. (A style can encode additional
information, too, such as boldface or italic configuration.)

The @racket[label-style] parameter is used for reduction-rule labels.
The @racket[literal-style] parameter is used for names that aren't
non-terminals that appear in patterns. The
@racket[metafunction-style] parameter is used for the names of
metafunctions. 
The @racket[paren-style] parameter is used for parentheses 
(including ``['', ``]'', ``@"{"'', and ``@"}"'',
as well as ``('' and ``)'') and for keywords, but it is not used for the square brackets of
in-hole decompositions, which use the @racket[default-style] parameter.
The @racket[grammar-style] parameter is used for the ``::='' and ``|''
in grammars.

The @racket[non-terminal-style] parameter is used for the names of non-terminals.
Two parameters style the text in the (optional) ``underscore'' component
of a non-terminal reference. The first, @racket[non-terminal-subscript-style],
applies to the segment between the underscore and the first caret (@racket[^]) 
to follow it; the second, @racket[non-terminal-superscript-style], applies
to the segment following that caret. For example, in the non-terminal 
reference @racket[x_y^z], @racket[x] has style @racket[non-terminal-style],
@racket[y] has style @racket[non-terminal-subscript-style], and @racket[z]
has style @racket[non-terminal-superscript-style]. The only exception to this
is when the subscript section consists only of unicode prime characters
(@litchar{′}), in which case the @racket[non-terminal-style] is used instead
of the @racket[non-terminal-subscript-style].

The @racket[default-style] parameter is used for parenthesis, the dot in dotted
lists, spaces, the
``where'' and ``fresh'' in side-conditions, and other places
where the other parameters aren't used.

it. The thunk may be invoked multiple times when rendering a
single reduction relation.

  A parameter whose value is a function to be used when typesetting metafunctions to
  determine how to create the @"\u27e6\u27e7"
  characters with @racket[homemade-white-square-bracket], which
  combines two @litchar{[} characters
  or two @litchar{]} characters together.
  
  The procedure accepts a string that is either @racket["["]

  numbers determine the offset (from the left and from the

  second two two numbers determine the extra space added (to
  the left and to the right respectively).

  The default value of the parameter is: @racketblock[

  Determines a width that is used for putting metafunction side

  @racket[metafunction-pict-style]). The default value is @racket[0],

  joining them does not change the overall width of the rendered
  metafunction. A larger value allows side conditions to be joined
  when they would make the rendered form wider, as long as the overall
  width of the metafunction does not exceed the specified value.

  For example, if the side conditions of a particular rule in a
  metafunction are all shorter than the rule itself,
  @racket[metafunction-fill-acceptable-width] has no effect. In
  contrast, if the rule itself is shorter than the side conditions and
  narrower than the space available to render (in a document for
  printing, for example), setting
  @racket[metafunction-fill-acceptable-width] can help. Setting it to
  the available width causes rendering to use the available horizontal
  space for joining side conditions.

@section[#:tag "pink"]{Removing the Pink Background}

@declare-exporting[redex/pict redex]

When reduction rules, a metafunction, or a grammar contains
unquoted Racket code or side-conditions, they are rendered
with a pink background as a guide to help find them and
provide an alternative typesetting for them. In general, a
good goal for a PLT Redex program that you intend to typeset
is to only include such things when they correspond to
standard mathematical operations, and the Racket code is an
implementation of those operations.

To replace the pink code, use:

@defform[(with-unquote-rewriter proc expression)]{

Installs @racket[proc] as the current unquote rewriter and
evaluates @racket[expression]. If that expression computes any picts,
the unquote rewriter specified is used to remap them.

The @racket[proc] must match the contract @racket[(-> lw? lw?)].
Its result should be the rewritten version version of the input.
}

@defform[(with-atomic-rewriter name-symbol

                               expression)]{

Extends the current set of atomic-rewriters with one
new one that rewrites the value of name-symbol to
@racket[string-or-pict-returning-thunk] (applied, in the case of a
thunk), during the evaluation of expression.

@racket[name-symbol] is expected to evaluate to a symbol. The value
of @racket[string-or-thunk-returning-pict] is used whenever the symbol
appears in a pattern.

                                 expression)]{

Extends the current set of compound-rewriters with one
new one that rewrites the value of name-symbol via proc,
during the evaluation of expression.

@racket[name-symbol] is expected to evaluate to a symbol. The value
of proc is called with a @racket[(listof lw)], and is expected to
return a new @racket[(listof (or/c lw? string? pict?))],
rewritten appropriately. 

The list passed to the rewriter corresponds to the
@racket[lw] for the sequence that has name-symbol's value at
its head.

The result list is constrained to have at most 2 adjacent
non-@racket[lw]s. That list is then transformed by adding
@racket[lw] structs for each of the non-@racket[lw]s in the
list (see the text just below the description of @racket[lw] for a
explanation of logical space):

@itemize[
@item{
    If there are two adjacent @racket[lw]s, then the logical
    space between them is filled with whitespace.}

@item{
    If there is a pair of @racket[lw]s with just a single
    non-@racket[lw] between them, a @racket[lw] will be
    created (containing the non-@racket[lw]) that uses all
    of the available logical space between the @racket[lw]s.
}

@item{
    If there are two adjacent non-@racket[lw]s between two
    @racket[lw]s, the first non-@racket[lw] is rendered
    right after the first @racket[lw] with a logical space
    of zero, and the second is rendered right before the
    last @racket[lw] also with a logical space of zero, and
    the logical space between the two @racket[lw]s is
    absorbed by a new @racket[lw] that renders using no
    actual space in the typeset version.
}]

One useful way to take advantage of @racket[with-compound-rewriters]
is to return a list that begins and ends with @racket[""] (the
empty string). In that situation, any extra logical space that
would have been just outside the sequence is replaced with an 
@racket[lw] that does not draw anything at all.

@ex[(with-compound-rewriter

The @racket[lw] data structure corresponds represents a pattern or a Racket
expression that is to be typeset.  The functions listed above
construct @racket[lw] structs, select fields out of them, and
recognize them. The @racket[lw] binding can be used with
@racket[copy-struct].

The values of the @racket[unq?] and @racket[metafunction?] fields, respectively,
indicate whether the @racket[lw] represents an unquoted expression or a 
metafunction application. See @racket[to-lw] for the meanings of the other fields.

}

@defform[(to-lw arg)]{

Turns @racket[arg] into @racket[lw] structs that
contain all of the spacing information just as it would appear
when being used to typeset.

Each sub-expression corresponds to its own lw, and
the element indicates what kind of sub-expression it is. If
the element is a list, then the lw corresponds to a
parenthesized sequence, and the list contains a lw
for the open paren, one lw for each component of the
sequence and then a lw for the close
parenthesis. In the case of a dotted list, there will also
be a lw in the third-to-last position for the dot.

For example, this expression:

@racketblock[(a)]

becomes this lw (assuming the above expression
appears as the first thing in the file):

@racketblock[
     (build-lw (list (build-lw "(" 0 0 0 1)
                     (build-lw 'a 0 0 1 1)
                     (build-lw ")" 0 0 2 1))
               0 0 0 3)
]

If there is some whitespace in the sequence, like this one:

@racketblock[
  (a b)
]

then there is no lw that corresponds to that
whitespace; instead there is a logical gap between the
lws.

@racketblock[
     (build-lw (list (build-lw "(" 0 0 0 1)
                     (build-lw 'a 0 0 1 1)
                     (build-lw 'b 0 0 3 1)
                     (build-lw ")" 0 0 4 1))
               0 0 0 5)
]

In general, identifiers are represented with symbols and
parenthesis are represented with strings and @racket[pict]s can be
inserted to render arbitrary pictures.

The line, line-span, column, and column-span correspond to
the logical spacing for the redex program, not the actual
spacing that will be used when they are rendered. The
logical spacing is only used when determining where to place
typeset portions of the program. In the absence of any
rewriters, these numbers correspond to the line and column
numbers in the original program.

The line and column are absolute numbers from the beginning
of the file containing the expression. The column number is
not necessarily the column of the open parenthesis in a
sequence -- it is the leftmost column that is occupied by
anything in the sequence. The line-span is the number of
lines, and the column span is the number of columns on the
last line (not the total width).

When there are multiple lines, lines are aligned based on
the logical space (i.e., the line/column &
line-span/column-span) fields of the lws. As an
example, if this is the original pattern:

@racketblock[
   (all good boys
        deserve fudge)
]

then the leftmost edges of the words "good" and "deserve"
will be lined up underneath each other, but the relative
positions of "boys" and "fudge" will be determined by the
natural size of the words as they rendered in the
appropriate font.

When @racket['spring] appears in the list in the @racket[e]
field of a @racket[lw] struct, then it absorbs all of the
space around it. It is also used by @racket[to-lw] when
constructing the picts for unquoted strings. For example, this expression

@racketblock[,x]

corresponds to these structs:

@racketblock[(build-lw (list (build-lw "" 1 0 9 0)
                             'spring
                             (build-lw x 1 0 10 1))
                       1 0 9 2)]

and the @racket['spring] causes there to be no space between
the empty string and the @racket[x] in the typeset output.

@defproc[(to-lw/stx [stx syntax?]) lw?]{
  A procedure variant of @racket[to-lw]; it accepts a 
  syntax object and returns the corresponding @racket[lw] structs.
  It only uses the location information in the syntax object,
