# redex

[PLT Redex](https://docs.racket-lang.org/redex/) is a domain-specific language designed for specifying and debugging operational semantics. 

Write down a grammar and the reduction rules, and PLT Redex allows you to interactively explore terms and to use randomized test generation to attempt to falsify properties of your semantics.

PLT Redex is embedded in Racket, meaning all of the convenience of a modern programming language is available, including standard libraries (and non-standard ones) and a program-development environment

This the source for the Racket packages: "redex", "redex-benchmark", "redex-doc", "redex-examples", "redex-gui-lib", "redex-lib", "redex-pict-lib", "redex-test".
